In this tutorial, you'll create a simple serverless web application that implements a "Todo app" with an API to store and retrieve tasks in a cloud database. In addition, we will integrate machine learning to automatically identify and label objects in images attached to tasks.

AWS Experience: Beginner (Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Linux command line knowledge is helpful)
Time to Complete: 2 hours
Tutorial Prerequisites: An AWS account, a text editor, recommended browser: latest version of Chrome or Firefox, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Rekognition, AWS Cloud9.

Application Architecture
The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and AWS Amplify Console. Amplify Console provides continuous deployment and hosting of the static web resources including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files which are loaded in the user's browser. JavaScript executed in the browser sends and receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and API Gateway. DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function. S3 is used to store uploaded images. Finally, Amazon Rekognition is used to detect and label objects in those images.
